## Program's guideline
The project is separate in multiple folders:
- src/ - contains all sources files
- include/ - contains all headers files 
- report/ - contains Latex sources
- ./ - root of the project, Makefile, readme...

Compile the program using the makefile as usual
> **Compile**: `make`

> **Compile in debug-mode**: `make -e DEBUG=true`
